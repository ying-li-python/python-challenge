# PyPoll 

Election results are here! How do we know who won in each county? Let's tally up the votes for each candidate. 

This folder contains the script that prints out the overall winner, the total number of votes per candidate (and percentage), and total votes.


## Resources 
- Election data has been kindly provided by UC Berkeley's Data Analytics and Visualization 

## Demonstration 

We would like Python to show: 
- Total votes of the election 
- Total number of votes for each candidate (and their percentages) 
- Winner of the election  

For this python script, we created data structures (dictionaries and list comprehensions), created for-loops, used ```len()```, ```round()```, ```.format()``` functions, and used the csv module to write our results in a new text file. 

Before starting, be sure to check the election data.
```
head election_data.csv 
```

To run the script: 
```
cd PyPoll 
python main.py 
```

Running this script will generate a new text file with the results.
