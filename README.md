# Python Challenge

This folder contains resulting Python scripts of four distinct Python Challenges.  

#### PyBoss 

In this data-centric world, we have to mantain old records as we upgrade into newer systems. But, old records have to be converted to an appropriate format to be read by the new system. In this case, let's convert employee records. 

This folder contains the script that for each employee, converts fullnames into first and last name, from the 9-digit SSN to hide the first five numbers with an asterisk, location by state to their abbreivations (California -> CA), and birthdate from YYYY-DD-MM to MM/DD/YYYY.

#### PyParagraph 

Suppose you want to assess the complexity of a written passage (whether it is for peer-reviewed research or for assessing high students' essays). Let's create a simple metric to analyze a single paragraph.

This folder contains the script that prints out the word count, sentence count, average sentence length, and average letter count.

#### PyPoll 

Election results are here! How do we know who won in each county? Let's tally up the votes for each candidate. 

This folder contains the script that prints out the overall winner, the total number of votes per candidate (and percentage), and total votes.

#### PyBank 

How can you tell if a company, out of hundreds, is doing financially well? Let's create a script that helps analyze financial records of any given company. 

This folder contains a script that looks at total months, average changes, profit/losses across the entire period.
