# Python Challenge

In this fast-paced society, there is a lot of data to analyze! Let's use Python to help us make our lives easier. This folder contains four dictinct ways to use Python in helping us collect data and perform data metrics.

## Getting started 
Download this parent folder and, under each Python challenge, run a Python script in command line. 

Example: 
```
git clone https://github.com/ying-li-python/python-challenge.git
cd python-challenge 
cd PyBank
python main.py 
```

### Instructions
We would like to mantain old records as we upgrade into newer systems. But, old records have to be converted to an appropriate format to be read by the new system. In this case, let's convert employee records. 

This folder contains the script that for each employee, converts fullnames into first and last name, from the 9-digit SSN to hide the first five numbers with an asterisk, location by state to their abbreivations (California -> CA), and birthdate from YYYY-DD-MM to MM/DD/YYYY.

## PyParagraph 

### Instructions
Suppose you want to assess the complexity of a written passage (whether it is for peer-reviewed research or for assessing high students' essays). Let's create a simple metric to analyze a single paragraph.

This folder contains the script that reports the word count, sentence count, average sentence length, and average letter count.

## PyPoll 

### Instructions
Election results are here! How do we know who won in each county? Let's tally up the votes for each candidate. 

This folder contains the script that reports the overall winner, the total number of votes per candidate (and percentage), and total votes.

## PyBank 

### Instructions
How can you tell if a company, out of hundreds, is doing financially well? Let's create a script that helps analyze financial records of any given company. 

This folder contains a script that for the entire period, reports total months, average changes, profit/losses.
