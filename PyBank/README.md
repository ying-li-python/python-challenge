# PyBank 
How can you tell if a company, out of hundreds, is doing financially well? Let's create a script that helps analyze financial records of any given company. 


## Resources 
- Financial data has been kindly provided by UC Berkeley's Data Analytics and Visualization 

## Demonstration 
For this python script, we created lists, set conditionals, created for-loops, and used the csv module to write our results. 

As a result, this script shows:
- Total months of the entire period 
- Total Profit of the entire period 
- Average change
- Greatest increase in profits 
- Greatest decrease in profits

To run the script: 
```
cd PyBank
python main.py 
```

This script will generate an output text file displaying the financial analysis.
